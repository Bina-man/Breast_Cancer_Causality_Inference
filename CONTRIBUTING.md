Group Work Policy
This submission is to be done individually or in groups of upto 4 people. Collaborative learning is highly encouraged.  We believe that groups of 2-3 people are likely to be most effective.  If you would like to join a group, you can ask the 10 Academy team to help match you into a group.  We recommend forming groups right away, ideally by Monday 23 Aug 2021 1300UTC.
